# vs_code_updater

Task Description: We have an update script for VS Code that runs on each server for a client. We want to centralize this check for our server. I'll attach a somewhat modified version of the original script here. We want to have the download of the VS Code installer done only once on the server that will run the script, and then if remote servers need an update, they should be able to do so from a remote fileshare.
